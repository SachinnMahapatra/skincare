## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project on your local machine after cloning:

### 1. Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v16 or higher recommended)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)

Check if you have them installed:
```bash
node -v
npm -v
```
If not, download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### 2. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd Assignment-2
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
This will install all required packages (React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, GSAP, etc).

### 4. Start the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
- The app will be available at the local address shown in your terminal (usually [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)).
- The page will reload automatically as you edit files.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting
- If you see errors about missing packages, run `npm install` again.
- If you change dependencies, restart the dev server.
- For Tailwind CSS to work, do **not** remove the `@tailwind` directives in `src/index.css`.
